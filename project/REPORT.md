## Synthesis results

In order to synthesize the DES cracker for the Zynq core of the Zybo board, we designed a Tcl synthesis script.

The array set of I/Os contains only the four `led` outputs that are mapped to the corresponding pins of the Zybo board. The output for the interrupt request to the CPU is connected to the reserved `IRQ_F2P` pin and configured to use the fabric interrupt of the board.

A variable `frequency_mhz` has been defined in the script to set the clock frequency running on the DES cracker. Note that, since the clock signal is taken directly from the CPU, only a set of discrete frequency values can be used and it is automatically set during the synthesis process.

Since the goal of this project is to optimally use the FPGA resources of the Zync core, the synthesis has been performed for different values of clock frequency and number of DES block instancies until we found the best solution for the design that met the board's contraints.

From the synthesis reports it is possible to analyze the results obtained with the various solutions. In particular, from the timing report we can see which is the clock frequency synthesized and check which is the critical path of our design. The maximum speed for which the design can meet all the timing constraints is reached with a frequency equal to 187.512 MHz, that corresponds to a clock period of 5.333 ns. The critical path is inside the `des_ctrl`: it starts from the generic register that is placed right after the DES block and passes firstly through the comparator and then through the combinatorial logic used for the key selection. This maximum delay path produces a slack of 0.007 ns, which is the difference between the required time and the arrival time to reach the last cell of the path.

Regarding the area constraints we can refer to the utilization report generated by the synthesis. The solution that uses the highest number of FPGA's slices consists on instantiating 12 DES blocks (specified in the code by the `DES_NUMBER` parameter). In this case the percentage of Slice LUTs used in the Zynq core is 92.34% and most of them are used for the logic. The Slice registers used as Flip-Flops are 18535 (corresponding to 52.66%) and are mainly due to the pipeline stages.
